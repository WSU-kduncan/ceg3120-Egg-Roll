# Project 1 Research and Documentation

## Setup:

- **Dependencies**:
  - Python3 (test)
  - Discord.py
  - Python-dotenv packages
- **How to get API token**:
  - Go to the Discord Developer Portal
  - Create an application, bot and a server. 
  - It should give you a token that you can copy under the bot tab. 
    - If not, click `Reset Token` and copy your new token. 
- **Where to put it to work with the code**:
  - Create a .env file
  - In that .env paste in your discord token like so:   
  ```
  # .env
  DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
  DISCORD_GUILD=your-guild-name
  ```

## Usage:

- **Commands**:
  - sdf
- Responses:
  - sdf

## Research:

- Some possible solutions to keep the bot running 24/7 is to purchase a VPS (virtual private server). They are not too expensive and will host your bot so you do not have to run the program all of the time (There are free ones too). Additionally, you could buy a Raspberry Pi and run it off of that. I think this will work because this seems to be the common answers according to my research.
